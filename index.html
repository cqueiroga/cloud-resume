					<p class="projectDescription">
						Chrome extension for the help desk to update their availability
						status in our phone system. By default, the phone system would
						require codes to be used in conjunction with your extension for
						tasks such as, signing in, signing out, taking lunch, etc. The
						Chrome extension made this process easier to allow the team to
						select their name and status with a GUI and the codes and extensions
						were selected based on the selections made.
